                            In this study, researchers used high-density EEG to investigate how infants' brains process audiovisual looming stimuli. The aim was to understand the timing strategies used by infants to anticipate the approaching stimuli and examine the differences between auditory and visual looms.

							The results showed that infants had earlier brain responses to the auditory loom compared to the visual loom. This suggests that infants prioritize auditory information when perceiving approaching objects. The timing strategies employed by the infants were found to be less sophisticated, relying on factors like visual angle, pitch, and velocity. However, these strategies led to errors in judging the time-to-collision of the looming stimuli, as they depended on the approach velocity.
							
							Interestingly, some infants demonstrated a more advanced strategy based on timing their responses to the collision of the visual loom. However, this strategy was not observed for the auditory loom. Additionally, infants showed closer brain responses to contact for faster looms, indicating their sensitivity to loom speed.
							
							When comparing the brain responses at different channels, the occipital channel (vision) showed higher amplitude peaks than the central channel (audition), suggesting that spatial attention is captured more by the visual loom.
							
							Overall, the study suggests that audiovisual integration is influenced by infants' spatial attention and their evolutionary bias for survival. The use of less sophisticated timing strategies reflects infants' neural maturity and locomotion experience, which are crucial for accurate timing of looming stimuli.
