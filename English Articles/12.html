                           To understand how infants develop visual motion perception, researchers used high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) to examine the effects of receiving extra motor stimulation during the first year of life. They compared infants who received extra motor stimulation with those who had a traditional Western upbringing.

							The study involved presenting the infants with different visual motion conditions using an optic flow paradigm. EEG data was collected and analyzed for visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and temporal spectral evolution (TSE) to understand the infants' brain responses.
							
							The results showed that traditionally-raised infants had difficulty distinguishing between different motion conditions in the first session, but they showed faster responses to structured optic flow (forwards and reversed) compared to random visual motion in the second session. In contrast, infants who received extra motor stimulation were able to differentiate between structured optic flow and random visual motion right from the first session. They also processed structured optic flow faster than random visual motion.
							
							The analysis of brain activity patterns further revealed that traditionally-raised infants exhibited desynchronized activities in specific frequency ranges, while extra-stimulated infants showed oscillatory activities in different frequency ranges.
							
							Overall, the findings suggest that extra motor stimulation during infancy can accelerate the development of visual motion perception. While traditionally-raised infants rely on natural neural maturation and self-produced locomotion, infants receiving extra motor stimulation benefit from an additional boost in their visual motion perception abilities.
							
							Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between extra motor stimulation and the development of visual motion perception in infancy.
