                            In this study, researchers wanted to investigate how baby swimming lessons, a form of extra motor-stimulation, can affect how infants perceive objects approaching them. They compared two groups of infants: one group that had received baby swimming lessons and another group with a more typical upbringing.

							To measure the infants' brain activity, the researchers used high-density electroencephalogram (EEG). The infants were exposed to a visual and auditory stimulus of an object moving closer to them at different speeds.
							
							The results showed that as the infants grew older, they became better at perceiving the approaching object. The infants who had received extra motor-stimulation initially responded to the stimulus slightly later than the other group, but this difference disappeared as they got older.
							
							Both groups of infants displayed different brain responses depending on the speed of the approaching object. Initially, all infants took longer to perceive slow-moving objects and less time to perceive medium and fast-moving objects. However, as the study progressed, all infants developed a more efficient timing strategy.
							
							The analysis of brain activity also revealed that as the infants grew older, their brain responses became more sophisticated, indicating improved processing of the visual and auditory information.
							
							Interestingly, during the first testing session, the infants who had received extra motor-stimulation showed more advanced brain activity compared to the other group.
							These findings suggest that extra motor-stimulation, such as baby swimming lessons, may contribute to the development of infants' ability to perceive and understand motion using multiple senses. To fully understand how motor-stimulation impacts motion perception, further research is needed. This research could potentially lead to interventions to support infants with atypical motion perception development.
