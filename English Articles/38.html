                            In this study, researchers examined how infants' brains respond to objects that are rapidly approaching them. They studied infants at 3/4 months and 11/12 months of age, comparing their brain activity using peak VEP (visual evoked potential) measurements recorded through EEG.

							The goal of the study was to understand how the infant brain reacts to a looming object approaching at different speeds. The results revealed differences in the peak VEP activation between the two age groups. At 3/4 months, infants showed a later activation of the VEP peaks compared to when they were 11/12 months old. Additionally, the VEP peaks had a longer duration at the younger age.
							
							These findings suggest that as infants grow older and gain more experience with movement, their brain responses to approaching objects become more efficient. The developmental trend observed in the study may be attributed to increased locomotor experience and improved perception of looming motion.
							
							Further research is needed to explore the relationship between infants' behavioral development and changes in brain activity associated with perceiving approaching objects. This will provide a deeper understanding of how infants' brains develop and respond to the world around them.
