                            This study focused on understanding how infants develop their ability to process visual motion information. Researchers used high-density electroencephalography (EEG) to examine the differences in brain development between full-term and preterm infants during their first year of life.

							The infants, consisting of both full-term and preterm infants, were tested with visual looming stimuli. By analyzing the visual evoked potentials (VEPs), the researchers were able to observe how the infants' brain responses to the looming stimuli changed over time.
							
							The findings revealed that the full-term infants showed improvements in their ability to estimate the time it takes for the looming object to collide. They initially relied on the visual angle of the approaching object, but as they grew older, their responses shifted to a more time-based strategy.
							
							In contrast, the preterm infants did not show the same developmental progression as the full-term infants. Their brain responses and strategies for estimating time-to-collision did not change significantly between the two test sessions.
							
							Furthermore, the analysis of brain oscillatory activity showed that the full-term infants displayed faster and shorter brain responses as they grew older, using higher oscillatory frequency bands. This development was not observed in the preterm infants.
							
							These differences in brain development suggest a vulnerability in the dorsal stream, which is responsible for processing visual motion, among preterm infants. The findings contribute to our understanding of how premature birth may impact the development of visual processing abilities in infants.
