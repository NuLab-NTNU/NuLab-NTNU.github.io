                            This study aimed to explore the differences in how 6-year-old full-term and premature children respond to audiovisual stimuli that simulate objects approaching. The researchers used a rotating circle as a visual stimulus at different speeds and measured the children's cortical and behavioral responses using high-density electroencephalogram (HD-EEG). The children's motor skills were also assessed using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (M-ABC).

							This study is the first to demonstrate electrical activity overlap between auditory and visual areas in 6-year-olds, indicating audiovisual integration. The researchers observed electrical activity moving from the auditory cortex to the visual cortex and upper parietal brain areas, which are part of the brain's dorsal stream responsible for processing visual information.
							Statistical analysis of the time-to-collision revealed that full-term children's brain responses aligned more closely with the approaching object's timing compared to preterm children. Full-term children showed synchronized responses between auditory and visual modalities, regardless of the speed of the approaching object. However, preterm children exhibited differences in their responses, with their visual responses occurring earlier than their auditory responses.
							
							These findings suggest that preterm 6-year-olds may have weaker audiovisual integration compared to full-term children. They also appear to have difficulty estimating the time of collision for the approaching object. The compensatory use of the auditory modality, possibly as a survival strategy, may explain why there were no significant differences in motor performance between preterm and full-term children.
							
							In summary, this study provides insights into how children respond to approaching objects and highlights potential differences between preterm and full-term development. The findings suggest that preterm children may rely more on auditory cues due to impaired visual motion perception. Understanding these differences can contribute to improving our knowledge of child development and supporting children with diverse needs.
