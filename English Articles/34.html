                            This study aimed to understand how infants develop their ability to perceive objects that are temporarily out of sight due to eye movements or occlusion. While previous research has focused on behavioral aspects, little is known about the underlying neural mechanisms.

							Infants at 4/5 months and 11/12 months of age participated in the study. Their eye movements were measured while they observed a moving stimulus that briefly disappeared behind an occluder. Additionally, neuronal gamma oscillations, which are associated with object processing and perception, were recorded using high-density electroencephalogram (EEG).
							
							The results showed that as infants grew older, they demonstrated more predictive gaze shifts over the occluder. This suggests an improved ability to anticipate the reappearance of the hidden object.
							
							Furthermore, the analysis of neuronal gamma oscillations revealed a shift in brain activity patterns. In the younger infants, the gamma oscillations were mainly observed in the occipital areas of the brain's dorsal pathway, which processes spatial and temporal information. In contrast, the older infants showed gamma oscillations in the anterior temporal areas of the ventral pathway, which is involved in object recognition and identification.
							
							These findings suggest that younger infants rely more on the location and timing of the object's disappearance, while older infants also take into account the object's identity for individualization processes.
							
							Understanding the development of object perception and the associated neural activity in infants provides valuable insights into how the visual system processes and integrates information. Further research is needed to explore the progression of these abilities and their impact on cognitive development.
