                            Biathlon, an Olympic winter sport, combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting. Success in biathlon relies on both physical fitness, including aerobic power and skiing efficiency, as well as precise shooting abilities. Heart rate regulation plays a crucial role in various aspects of a biathlon competition, and the ability to prospectively control heart rate may be important for optimal performance.

							This study examined preparatory heart rate patterns during simulated biathlon events using electrocardiography (ECG) in a field test. Ten national-level junior biathletes participated in the test, skiing multiple sets of laps on a standardized course, followed by shooting in a standing position. Changes in heart rate were analyzed during specific periods: before the start, when approaching uphill terrain, and before shooting.
							
							The results showed that there was a significant increase in heart rate in the 15 seconds leading up to the start, particularly in the last 10 seconds. Before shooting, there was a significant decrease in heart rate during the final 30 to 10 seconds. Additionally, there was a significant increase in heart rate before approaching uphill terrain compared to a flat control round.
							
							These findings suggest the occurrence of prospective heart rate control in biathlon. Prospective control involves preparing the body for the upcoming physical effort by adjusting heart rate, which can optimize the body's readiness for the challenges ahead.
							
							In summary, prospective heart rate control in biathlon allows athletes to proactively prepare their bodies for the demands of the sport, ensuring optimal performance. Understanding and harnessing this mechanism can be valuable for biathletes aiming to excel in their competitions.
