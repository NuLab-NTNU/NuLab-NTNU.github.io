                            In this study, researchers used high-density EEG to investigate how the brain responds to different speeds of simulated forward motion in adult participants. The participants were shown a virtual road with moving poles at the sides, simulating motion at three different speeds (low, medium, and high), with breaks in between each speed condition.

							The results showed significant differences in the brain's response to the different speeds. The N2 component, which represents visual motion processing, had longer latencies and lower peak amplitudes as the speed increased. This suggests that the slower speed was easier for the brain to process compared to the faster speeds, and more neurons were attuned to the slower speed.
							
							Oscillatory activity in the theta and alpha frequency bands was observed, but no significant differences were found between the speeds. However, when comparing the speeds to a static control condition, significant differences were found in the alpha band. The alpha band showed de-synchronizations during the different speeds, indicating an activated state related to visual processing. In contrast, the static condition showed alpha synchronizations, suggesting a deactivated resting period.
							
							Overall, the study suggests that the brain's response to simulated forward motion varies depending on the speed. The slower speed is easier to process, and more neurons are involved in perceiving it. The oscillatory activity in the alpha band reflects the brain's activation during visual processing, while the synchronizations during the static condition indicate a resting period.
