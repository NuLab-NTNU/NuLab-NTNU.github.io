                            This longitudinal study used electroencephalogram (EEG) to examine brain activity in response to different visual motion stimuli in 5 participants tested at ages 4 months, 12 months, and 6 years. The researchers analyzed visual evoked potentials (VEP) and time-spectral evolution (TSE) data recorded using EEG sensors.

							The results showed that as the participants grew older, there was a significant decrease in latency, indicating faster brain responses to visual motion. However, no significant differences were found between the specific types of visual motion or their interaction effects.
							
							Individual analysis revealed that at 4 months, infants displayed desynchronized theta-band activity when exposed to motion stimuli, while synchronized theta-band activity was observed for static non-flow stimuli. At 12 months, infants showed a similar pattern but with more activity in the alpha- and beta-band ranges. Older children exhibited increased alpha- and beta-band activity and synchronized activity specifically in response to motion stimuli, resembling patterns seen in adults.
							
							The study suggests that the development of visual perception of optic flow is influenced by both neurobiological development and increased self-produced locomotor experience. However, due to the small number of participants, further research with a larger sample size is needed to better understand the development of visual motion perception from infancy to childhood.
							
							In summary, this EEG study provides insights into the developmental changes in brain activity related to visual motion perception, highlighting the importance of both biological factors and experience in shaping this ability.
