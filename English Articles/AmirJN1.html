                            There have been wide discussions among scientists during the last few decades on how human babies are affected by birth 
                            conditions, what are the best ways to investigate and predict neurobehavioral and neurodevelopmental trends of newborns, 
                            how babies learn about themselves and the world, whether it is possible to detect abnormalities such as neurological 
                            deficits as earliest as possible for early intervention purposes, and how to boost babies’ brain and their body functions 
                            interactively from day one of life. To answer these questions, I would like to grab your attention to the ongoing scientific
                             activities and findings in our multidisciplinary laboratory at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).<br><br>
                            Global studies and particularly the results from our Developmental Neuroscience Laboratory (Nu-Lab) at NTNU highlight the importance of structured 
                            studies to capture and lighten the differences between babies’ brains particularly during the first 2 years of life, and how early detection and 
                            consequently early stimulation would greatly influence newborn babies’ life. The main focus of studies at Nu-Lab is to understand the neurodevelopment 
                            of vision and sensorimotor coordination throughout lifespan. Therefore, newborn babies and participants of later ages have been widely investigated by 
                            the advanced scientists who utilize well developed methods and technologies such as electroencephalography (EEG), eye-tracking, neuropsychological 
                            battery, and human machine intelligence. These are used to determine the function of visual perception, attention, sensorimotor coordination, motor 
                            skills, and their development in babies, focusing on both early and later years of life in general during last 30 years.<br><br>  
                            Scientific findings from such an advanced and supervised laboratory by Prof. Audrey van der Meer and Prof. Ruud van der Weel and us as research 
                            associates address different research questions related to neuropsychological (dys)functions in early stages of life to prevent and facilitate 
                            development through lifespan. These studies are very essential for designing any program for healthy neuro-psycho-physiological development 
                            especially why and how some babies develop problems. To achieve these goals, scientists in Nu-lab study human neurodevelopment using different 
                            types of studies and research paradigms e.g., neuro-behavioral changes during first year of life in new born babies, comparing preterm, near term 
                            and full term born babies at the earliest stages of life toward adulthood as a longitudinal study investigating at different ages.<br><br>
                            Such studies enable us, as scientists, to understand how babies and toddlers develop, and simultaneously help us to facilitate, enrich and 
                            optimize our neurodevelopmental programs to offer training packages, tips and techniques to different target groups e.g., parents, educators, 
                            clinicians and other groups of professionals. <br><br> 

                            <h3>Why Nu-Lab researchers interested to study preterm and near term born babies?<br><br> </h3>
                            
                            Epidemiological studies reported that approximately, on average, 9-12% of children were born preterm globally, 25% of which have low weight and 
                            some kind of visual impairment (approximately 2% of them are blind). Being born preterm is one of the main causes of death during the first 5 years 
                            of life and, in case of survival, children will be at great risk of short- and long-term morbidities which cannot be necessarily improved by 
                            different means of rehabilitations and therapeutic approaches. More importantly, due to lack of adequate healthcare in low- and middle-income 
                            countries, preterm babies die or face a lot of personal and health challenges as they don’t get enough attention, treatment and rehabilitation
                            programs in their home countries. To blame is not only the lack of facilities and medical equipment but also the limited knowledge about brain, 
                            body, life issues and particularly neurodevelopmental related aspects and underlying mechanisms throughout life span. As we know, these play key 
                            roles in one’s daily life e.g., in speech, balance and walking, sensorimotor skills, social skills and interaction with the environment. Crucially, 
                            learning is also one of the prerequisites for a good life quality and well-being. Not only preterm borns which is one of our main target groups at 
                            Nu-Lab, but also full term borns can be affected by birth, environmental or internal stressors, family issues, infections, and many other risk 
                            factors.<br><br>
                            Lack of consideration of these aspects can increase the rate of mortality for both preterm born children/adolescents or adults, or indirectly other 
                            people living alongside them in the societies for a longer period of time. For example, being preterm born is itself leading to high rates of 
                            seizure, cerebral palsy, visual and hearing problems etc., and also increases the vulnerability of life-time disorders, especially the risk of 
                            being diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. From both neuro- and psycho-physiological perspectives, 
                            the first 5-6 years of life are very crucial, with unimaginably valuable experiences. Thus, this period of life and these differences received the 
                            highest level of attention from neurodevelopmental scientists and especially by our lab experts as every other aspects of human beings such as 
                            personality, bio-psycho-socio-spiritual, cognitive and emotions are actually formed. <br><br> 

                            My next article will focus on the importance of early stimulation programs and how Nu-lab studies contributed to the development of such programs. <br><br>
