                            This study aimed to understand how infants process looming stimuli, which indicate the rapid approach of objects, and provide valuable information about potential impacts. Researchers used brain electrical recordings (EEG) to explore the characteristics of looming-related visual evoked potentials (VEP) in 12 infants aged 3/4 and 11/12 months.

							The study examined how infants at these early ages respond to virtual objects approaching on a collision course at different speeds. Additionally, the researchers applied the General Tau Theory to investigate how neural information is processed in the infant brain.
							
							The results revealed age-related differences in the timing and duration of VEP responses. At 3/4 months, infants showed VEP peaks after the virtual objects had already hit them. In contrast, at 11/12 months, infants exhibited clear VEP peaks related to looming before the virtual impact.
							
							Furthermore, the application of the General Tau Theory suggested that as infants mature and gain more experience with movement, their ability to perceive and interpret looming-related information improves. This increased locomotor experience provides them with more accurate information about the time-to-collision.
							
							The findings suggest that brain maturation, combined with the significant increase in locomotor experience during the first year of life, may explain the observed developmental trend. Further research is needed to investigate the specific brain activity associated with infants' perception of looming motion.
							
							Understanding how infants process looming objects can provide valuable insights into their visual perception and help us better comprehend their development during this critical period of growth.
